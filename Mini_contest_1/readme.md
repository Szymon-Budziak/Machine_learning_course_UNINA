## Mini contest 1

The aim of
the [Machine Learning Mini-Contest 1](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/unina-machine-learning-2223) is to
predict the class of AGB ("Absent", "Low", "Medium", "High", "Very High") using the spectral bands of Sentinel-2 and
vegetation indices that can be constructed from the bands. The task is thus configured as a multi-class classification
problem.
